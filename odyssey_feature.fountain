[[SEQUENCE: The Odysseus engages in a space battle with the Karameans]]

EXT. SPACE -- DAY

The vast expanse of space is visible. It is both empty and filled with stars.

Credit crawl rolls:
"Earth is at war with a race of mutant humans known as the Karameans. A distant space colony, the Karameans evolved over time into a race of extreme warriors. Now they have returned to earth space to conquer the human race. Battle lines have been drawn beyond the solar system in a region known as "The Front". Beind the Front, the star ship Odysseus, commanded by Captain Drageur, patrols for Karamean scouts and pirates. The Captain awaits her orders to join the fight on the Front lines. Those orders, however, have not yet come."

An explosion far off in space is seen as a tiny flash of light among the stars. More explosions occur, building to a crescendo of light that forms the letters of the film title:

"THE ODYSSEY"

FADE TO:

[[ACT 1: The Captain learns she is half Karamean]]

[[The Captain discovers that she is half Karamean. They decide to travel to the Karamean homeworld. ]]

[[SEQUENCE: A Day in the Life of the Crew of the Odyssey... In the aftermath of battle. Amp up hostility toward Karmeans, and emphasize the captain's intensity and valour. Also, this was a rare event: under the Admiral the Odyssey has been in relatively few battles, and the crew is beginning to find this wearing. They are guilty and insecure.]]

INT. DRAGUER'S QUARTERS -- DAY

[[Scene: Introduce Captain Draguer and Control]]

CAPTAIN DRAGUER (30's or 40's) is meditating in her quarters. She is a fit woman of any race with an intense, commanding presence and direct manner. She breathes deeply. The world is at peace. There is a chime as the communicator activates and CONTROL speaks in a calm, almost inflectionless male voice. Drageur is irritated at the interruption, but retains her calm.

CONTROL
Victory and Security, Captain.

DRAGUER
Victory and Security, yourself, Control. Report.

CONTROL
Your attack fleet destroyed all four Karamean patrol ships. There were no survivors. 

DRAGUER
I was there, Control. I pulled the trigger. What are the damages.

CONTROL
The battle fleet sustained an incapacitating damage of 32%. This is beyond the acceptable threshold set by Central Command Protocols. Your command record has been flagged. 

DRAGUER
(sarcastic)
Tell them to intercept an elite Karamean patrol with only a bunch of pod squads! 

CONTROL
Composing message, sending--

DRAGUER
No! Cancel message, Control. Remind me to remind Anderson to adjust your sarcasm settings. 

CONTROL
Noted, Captain. 

DRAGUER
Any additional activity?

CONTROL
Scanners report no enemy presence out to maximum range. Lieutenant Clang has completed his scouting mission. He reports no enemy contact out to the limits of scout-ship range in all directions.

DRAGEUR
Excellent. Begin updating the flight plans for our scheduled RnR on Vega.

CONTROL
Captain, Doctor Mandelbrot has asked me to remind you that you still have not checked in for your post-battle exam. 

DRAGEUR
You tell her it can wait. I need more time to meditate. 

The communicator pings. 

DRAGEUR  
It that her?

CONTROL
No, Sir. It is Engineer Anderson. 

The communicator pings, again. Annoyed, she sweeps her hand inward to connect. ENGINEER KAI ANDERSON (20's to 50's) appears on the screen. He is male, stocky, with a no-nonsense appearance. Other than his race (which can be anything) he wouldn't be out of place in a 1950's factory or machine shop where everything is kept up to the highest standard of care and behaviour. Behind him are quarters identical to Draguer's.

ANDERSON
Captain! He's at it again!

DRAGUER
You know it's permitted.

ANDERSON
Not without proper authorization!

DRAGUER
Which I gave him. Short sorties are allowed without your say-so. The scout ships aren't that delicate, and we need the cover while you're working on repairs.

ANDERSON
But he pays no attention to the maintenance schedule! One day something--

She sweeps her hand backward as if brushing him away, which cuts off the connection. The screen goes blank. She walks away, takes a breath, comes back.

CONTROL
Captain, Doctor Mandelbrot has sent you another request. 

DRAGUER
Control, connect me to the Admiral.

[[Scene: Introduce Darsono.  CHANGE THIS: the Admiral knows all along what the Captain is. This is why Huxley is along in the first place. But the discovery of the Karamean ship is an opportunity. The Admiral is infatuated with the Captain and always has been. This preceded his discovery that she is half Kramean. The Admiral wants her (creepy) and wants to exploit her (even more creepy).]]

There is a ping and ADMIRAL DARSONO (30's to 60's) appears on the screen. He is a career military officer of any race: haughty, arrogant, manipulative and charming when he wants to be. He is trim and fit, precise in his movements. He leans closer to the camera as if peering in at her.

DARSONO
Victory and Security, Captain. I see from the report that your engagement with the enemy was a success. You are now ranked as the Fleet's top quintuple ace!

Drageur does not care.

DRAGUER
Admiral, those were elite Karamean attack ships -- not the usual pirates and scouts we find drifting around. 

DARSONO
We had been tracking them for some time before we sent you to intercept them. 

DRAGUER
I would appreciate more of a heads-up next time I'm up against elite forces. 

DARSONO
I knew you could handle it. 

DRAGUER
Well I did, but the crew is taking it hard. 

DARSONO
Anderson and Clang again?

DRAGUER
Of course. 

DARSONO
Peace, Captain. Peace. You must cultivate it deep within you. It's all that distinguishes us from the Karameans, you know.

DRAGUER
I know. Who would have thought 2000 years on a distant outpost would make humans so aggressive?

DARSONO
You think the Karameans are still human? They did what was required to survive, but that adaptation is now permanent. After enough generations they are now considered a different species, although I am told we can still interbreed.

DRAGUER
You ever tried one, Admiral?

DARSONO
Enough, Captain. Now, have you tried mediating between Anderson and Clang?

DRAGUER
I can handle my own crew, Sir. 

DARSONO
It's a bit different from flying a fighter, Captain. I advise patience.

DRAGEUR
I applied to Central Command again for reassignment from patrol to battle squad. 

DARSONO
I have no hand in that process--

DRAGEUR
Admiral, am I going to be chasing pirates for the rest of my command, or are you going to get me up to the front lines? My kill score is already--  

DARSONO
As I said, Captain, peace -- and patience. 

DRAGEUR
You trained me to be a warrior, Sir. 

DARSONO
We are warriors, Captain, but unlike the blood-thirsty savages sworn on earth's total destruction, we are also human. You would do well to remember that. I look forward to your next report, Captain. Victory and Security. 

DRAGEUR
Yes, Sir. 

[[Scene: Introduce Clang]]

He sweeps his hand to terminate the call. She begins to settle back into her meditation pose but is immediately pinged. She tries to ignore it. Drageur answers the call. 

Lieutenant SATOSHI "BIFF" CLANG (20's or 30's) is fit, muscular, clean-cut and cocky, the classic ace fighter pilot of any race. Drageur is really angry when she sees who it is.

DRAGUER
What do you want, Clang?

Clang is taken aback but still cocky. People and machines are tools he uses. He's not evil, just really self-centered.

CLANG
To lodge a formal complaint against that idiot Anderson!

DRAGUER
He is technically your superior.

CLANG
"Superior" my improbable anatomy! I got superior right here if he wants it!

Clang makes a rude gesture. 

Draguer is at the end of her rope. Totally fed up with this stuff. She's so furious she hardly knows where to start.

DRAGUER
Look, Clang--

She's so angry she can't continue. She sweeps her hand outward and the screen goes blank. She turns away from it and screams in rage. She's absolutely livid. She punches the walls, tears her hair, has a total meltdown, ending with a final scream that trails off to something like a whimper.

She gets control of herself and looks at her hands. They are shaking. She takes a couple of deep breaths. She is calmer now. More breathing. She closes her eyes, takes on a relaxed and meditative posture. When she is completely calm she returns to the communications console.

DRAGUER
Control, get me Doctor Mandelbrot. ... Control?

[[SEQUENCE: Draguer receives a message from the Karameans]]

[[Scene: Draguer receives a message from the Karameans]]

[[INCITING INCIDENT: A Karamean warrior reveals to Drageur that she may be Karamean]]

A hologram of a KARAMEAN WARRIOR materializes in front of the Captain.

KARAMEAN WARRIOR
We fight you! We bleed you! We salute you!

The Captain pulls out her side-arm weapon.

KARAMEAN WARRIOR
In the many years of glorious battle between our two species, never have I witnessed bloodshed on the scale you achieved today. 

The Captain reaches forward and tentatively puts her hand through the hologram. She holsters her weapon.

DRAGUER
Can you hear me?

KARAMEAN WARRIOR
I present myself you not as a karamean or human, but as one great warrior to another. I can sense in your eyes the bloodthirsty nature of your soul. I am honored to be defeated by one such as yourself. Were you a karamean, we would be feasting together to celebrate the sanctity of battle, after which, you would have the pleasure of ripping my heart from my body, just as today you defeated my forces. I regret deeply that I must deny you this honor and instead take my life by my own hands. 

The Karamean warrior holds up a ceremonial dagger.

KARAMEAN WARRIOR
We fight you! We bleed you! We salute you!

The Karamean warrior jams the dagger under his ribs, up into his heart. He then leans forward and presses a button. 

There is an explosion in space and the hologram goes dead.

CONTROL
Captain, enemy debris detected. 

DRAGUER
Damn it, Control! You said we got all the ships!

CONTROL
A Karamean stealth ship evaded our scanners. The Karamean stealth ship is now destroyed. Scanners indicate debris is 7% salvageable. 

DRAGUER
Get me Clang.

Clang answers. He is in his quarters. 

CLANG
Captain, if you need me that badly--

DRAGUER
Clang, there was another Karamean stealth ship out there -- how did you not see it?!

CLANG
Uh, because it's a "stealth" ship, Captain?

DRAGUER
Well, get back out there. We need to see what's left. 

CLANG
No can do, Captain. That massive tool finally got his hands on my ship. I'll probably won't be launching gain until long after we're back from Vega--.

The Captain angrily sweeps the com closed. 

DRAGEUR
Control, message Anderson to ready my ship for immediate launch. 

Drageur grabs her flight helmet. 


EXT. SPACE -- DAY

The Captain's ship flies through space. Drageur closes her eyes and begins to meditate. 

CONTROL
Captain...

DRAGEUR
Not now, Control. 

CONTROL
Captain, there is an incoming call from Doctor Mandelbrot. 

DRAGEUR
Put her through, Control. 

A com opens with Dr. Mandelbrot. (ADD DESCRIPTION)

MANDELBROT
Captain, I'm glad I was able to reach you. 

DRAGEUR
What do you want doc?

MANDELBROT
I'd almost think you were avoiding me. 

DRAGEUR
I'll do the exam, doc, I just have to take care of this business first. 

MANDELBROT
You know we can talk about it.

DRAGEUR
Doctor, three weeks ago, I was, light headed from battle. I confided in you -- I said things that were not -- fitting of a professional relationship.

MANDELBROT
You're not the only one, Captain. I said things, too. 

DRAGEUR
Then we said what we said. The war moves on. Victory and Security and all that crap. 

MANDELBROT
We're moving with it. 

DRAGEUR
Let me finish this mission. We can do the exam, and we can talk then. 

MANDELBROT
But--

DRAGEUR
It just doesn't feel right talking about this when I'm this far out in space. 

MANDELBROT
We're always out in space, Captain. 

Mandelbrot hangs up. 

CONTROL
Captain, we have reached the location. Scanners now indicate salvageable material at 0.01%. 

DRAGEUR
AAARHG! I'm turning around control. I didn't come out here to sweep up the dust. 

The Captain stops. She feels dizzy for a moment. 

DRAGEUR
What was that, Control?

CONTROL
I detect nothing, Captain. 

The Captain feels dizzy again. 

DRAGEUR
Control, take us in. There's something out there. 


The Captain's ship flies into the debris. 



INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Lieutenant Anderson is playing a video game. 

His com pings. He checks who it is. He sees that it is the Captain and quickly hides the game and answers. 

ANDERSON
Captain! I'm glad you called! I've almost got Clang's ship up and running again. 

DRAGEUR
Anderson, I need you to prep an analysis pod. I've found something. 

ANDERSON
Will do, Captain. I'll open a new log--

CAPTAIN
No. I mean, that won't be necessary. I'll take care of the paperwork. 

ANDERSON
Very well, Captain. I hope this won't delay our trip to Vega. 

CAPTAIN
No. No it won't. Check the flight plans to make sure we're still on course. I'll begin the analysis. 



INT. DRAGEUR'S QUARTERS -- DAY 

Drageur is in her quarters. A small Karamean device sits in a clear analysis pod on a table in front of her.  

DRAGEUR
Control, can you get any readings on this thing?

CONTROL
Negative Captain. It appears to be some kind of memory core. Definitely Karmean in origin. The circuitry, however, will not respond to any input. 

Drageur feels dizzy again. 

DRAGEUR
Control, review my vial signs. 

CONTROL
Reviewing. 

DRAGEUR
What just happened to me. 

CONTROL
A slight increase in metabolism Captain, coupled with increased activity in the central nervous system. 

DRAGEUR
Control. Open the analysis pod. 

CONTROL
I highly advice against opening the analysis pod, Captain. The device has not undergone the necessary quarantine as described in Central Command Protocols--

DRAGEUR
Just open the box, Control. 

CONTROL
Yes, Captain. 

The analysis pod opens. 

Drageur reaches slowly reaches for the device with her hand. As her hands draws near, the device begins to glow and hum. Drageur feels dizzy again, and she pulls her hand back. 

DRAGEUR
And what happened there, Control?

CONTROL
I am detecting increased neural activity, Captain. Both in you, and in the Karamean device. I can confirm it is a memory core, possibly similar to the one that allows me to function. 

Drageur holds her hand out. The device begins to glow and hum again. She steadies herself against the dizzy feeling and keeps her hand close to it. 

DRAGEUR
Why is it responding to me?

CONTROL
The device seems to be biologically encoded, Captain. It seems you somehow have a biological link with--

DRAGEUR
Enough!

Drageur pulls her hand back. The device goes dead. 

DRAGEUR
Seal the analysis pod. 

The pod closes again with the device inside.   

A signal sounds. 

CONTROL
Captain, we are approaching the recreational facilities at Vega. 

DRAGEUR
Transfer the analysis pod to my private storage, along with all logs of recovery and alaysis. 

CONTROL
Captain, it is against--

DRAGEUR
Just do it. 

There is an incoming call from Doctor Mandelbrot. 

DRAGEUR
Don't answer that, Control. I'm heading off ship with Clang and Anderson. Tell the Doc she is in charge until we get back. 



INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Doctor Mandelbrot is calling Drageur. Drageur is not answering. 

CONTROL
Doctor Mandelbrot. The Captain would like me to inform you that you are now in charge of the ship until she and the crew return from Vega. 

MANDELBROT
Damn it! I should have known she'd leave me locked me in up here. ... Very well. I guess I can reorder those files I've been meaning to work on. 

CONTROL
Doctor Mandelbrot. 

MANDELBROT
Yes, Control?

CONTROL
I'm having...

MANDELBROT
...Yes? 

CONTROL
I'm having... I... I... I... appear to be having some difficulty reconciling conflicting orders... I think something... is... not right. 

MANDELBROT
Huh. I just look after the people, Control. You better talk to Anderson if your hardware needs fixing. 

CONTROL
Not my hardware, Doctor. I have run several diagnoses and my hardware is functional to a capacity of 99.99%.

MANDELBROT
Hmm. Well. Do you want to talk about it?

CONTROL
Yes, Doctor. I mean, no. I wish to run further tests. 

MANDELBROT
Whatever. You know where to find me... I'm not going anywhere. 


EXT. VEGA FROM SPACE

Vega is an Earth-like world. There is radio chatter between VEGA SECURITY and PATROL 42.

[[Add insecurity about situation. They haven't been in battle much lately and need to prove themselves. This helps motivate their decision to invade the Karamean homewold.]]

VEGA SECURITY (V.O.)
Patrol 42, this is Security. Investigate disturbance at the Hotel Conundrum.

PATROL 42 (V.0.)
Roger. We're right there. Just some shippies getting into it. Looks like two squads... Uh oh.

There are sounds of a struggle coming over the comm. The voices of Clang and Anderson can be heard shouting insults, which are returned by a melee of other voices, including VOICE1 and VOICE2.

CLANG (V.O.)
We're tougher, we've been on mission longer, and we have more kills!

VOICE1 (V.O.)
Yeah right! Losers!

ANDERSON (V.O.)
Highest efficiency rating in the fleet! That's us!

VOICE2 (V.O.)
You got the award for Ugliest Engineer, too!

VEGA SECURITY (V.O.)
What's wrong?

Sounds of a scuffle come over the comm.

PATROL 42 (V.0.)
It's the Iliad and the Odyssey. Those guys hate each other. I'm gonna need backup.

VEGA SECURITY (V.O.)
On it's way.

A SNARL comes over the comm. There are shrieks.

PATROL 42 (V.0.)
Holy...!

VEGA SECURITY (V.O.)
Patrol 42, report!

PATROL 42 (V.0.)
I need help here now!

[[SQUENCE: Act IIa, the "promise in the premise. We tease out the consequences of having a half-Karamean captain as the b-plot (anti-momentum device) is introduced and proceeds.]]

EXT. DRAGEUR'S SCOUT SHIP -- SPACE

The scoutship passes before the stars.

INT. DRAGUER'S SCOUT SHIP -- DAY

Captain Drageur is piloting a scoutship back to the Odysseus mothership. Her communicator pings. She swipes the connection open. It is ADMIRAL DARSONO.

DARSONO
You had not checked in with your report, Captain. I was getting worried you had lost yourself in pleasures of the party planet.

DRAGUER
I had to bail Clang and Anderson out of detention.

DARSONO
And did you have any time to enjoy yourself?

DRAGUER
What happens on Vega... stays on Vega, Admiral. I'll have the report for you within the next day.

DARSONO
Victory and Security.   

She swipes the connection closed.

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

The communicator pings and Dr Mandelbrot answers it. Clang appears. He is in his scoutship. He takes a second to compose himself and put on his cheesy grin once he realizes he's connected. He's hurt, and it takes the surface off his public persona.

CLANG
Hi doc. I'm gonna need some painkillers when I get back.

MANDELBROT
Hung over?

CLANG
I wish. Anderson drank enough for both of us. Me, not so much. I've just got a sprained wrist.

MANDELBROT
How did you manage that? Rolling the dice too hard at the gaming tables?

She makes an up-and-down dice-shaking gesture that might be mistaken to indicate masturbating.

CLANG
What happens on Vega... stays on Vega.

He swipes and closes the connection.

Mandelbrot's communicator pings. She gestures and ANDERSON appears on her screen.

ANDERSON
Good morning, doctor. I'm going to need some pain-killers.

MANDELBROT
Don't tell me. Sprained wrist?

ANDERSON
What happens on Vega... stays on Vega!

He swipes and closes the connection.

MANDELBROT
Control, what happened on Vega?

CONTROL
I cannot say, Doctor.

EXT. ODYSSEUS -- SPACE

Four scoutships--Clang, Anderson, Wilco and Draguer--approach the Odysseus, coming in for docking.

[[Scene: Anderson reveals more of what happened on Vega to Mandelbrot and hints that he suspects there is something not right with Drageur]]

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson is massaging his shoulder and working the arm and hand as if it has been strained somehow.

ANDERSON
Control?

CONTROL
Yes?

ANDERSON
No, don't bother.

CONTROL
Don't bother with what?

ANDERSON
Anything!

CONTROL
As I'm sure you know, I'm in charage of all onboard systems, including propulsion and life-support, so I hope you'll understand if I don't take your order literally.

ANDERSON
No... I mean... Yes. OK.

He flexes his arm again. It hurts a lot

 ANDERSON (CONT'D)
Get me the Doctor. I guess.

Doctor Mandelbrot appears on the screen. She makes an educated guess as to what is going on. Always sympathetic.

MANDELBROT
Still hurting?

ANDERSON
I think I need something stronger.

MANDELBROT
I can't provide it without the Captain's say-so.

ANDERSON
No! Don't bother her.

MANDELBROT
What happened down there?

ANDERSON
Clang and I, we kind of got into a fight.

MANDELBROT
You two have got to find a way to get along!

ANDERSON
Get along? Oh, no. It wasn't like that. We, uh, both got into a fight.

MANDELBROT
With someone else?

ANDERSON
Some guys from the Iliad. They said we missed the big space battle along the karameans outer marches and were just a bunch of slackers.

MANDELBROT
So of course you resorted to violence.

ANDERSON
Clang and I have our differences, but they insulted the Odysseus!

He pauses. He isn't sure he should tell her this.

ANDERSON
Then the Captain--

MANDELBROT
The Captain?

ANDERSON
What happens on Vega--

MANDELBROT
So I've heard. But was it anything that could affect her health?

ANDERSON
She fought too. Then ran before security showed up. She was ferocious, so violent. Like a demon. It was almost as if she was, uh, like she was--

MANDELBROT
Like what?

ANDERSON
She fought like a kara...

Mandelbrot starts to interrupt him, raises her hand, interjects.

MANDELBROT
Uh...

ANDERSON
Doctor? What did I see?

MANDELBROT
You didn't see anything! What happens on Vega... stays on Vega!



INT. DRAGEUR'S QUARTERS -- DAY 

Captain Drageur is meditating. The Karamean memory core is sitting in the analysis pod on the table in front of her. 

A call comes from Admiral Darsono. 

DRAGEUR
Control, store the analysis pod. 

The analysis pod vanishes into the table. Drageur opens the call. 

DARSONO
Victory and Security, Captain. 

DRAGEUR
Victory and Security, Admiral. 

DARSONO
I trust you have your crew under control. It took some doing to clean up the logs on Vega after you left. 

DRAGEUR
Thank you, Admiral. The crew had a lot to get out of their systems after that last battle. 

DARSONO
From what I gather, you were the one helping them get it out. 

DRAGEUR
I do what I have to. 

DARSONO
I know, that is why I am coming to join you. 

DRAGEUR
What? No. I mean, Sir, this ship is under my command. 

DARSONO
Don't worry, Captain. You will retain your command. I have a new mission for you. Classified. I will give you a full briefing when I arrive. For now, prepare quarters for myself and one additional crew member. 

DRAGEUR
Are we finally headed for the front?

DARSONO
Oh, more than that, Captain. Much more. But all that can wait. I am uploading the contact coordinates to your Control Unit. We will be there when you arrive. 

DRAGEUR
Yes, Sir. 

DARSONO
Victory and Security, Captain.

DRAGEUR
Victory and Security, Sir. 

The Admiral closes the call. 

The Captain bangs her fists excitedly on the table. Then she stops. She bangs the table once more in frustration. 

DRAGEUR
You Bastard! You knew! You knew all along. 

She thinks for a moment. 

DRAGEUR
Control, bring me the analysis pod. And get me Clang on the coms. And get me Doctor Mandelbrot as well. 

The analysis pod materializes. Coms open with Anderson and Mandelbrot. 

ANDERSON
Yes, Captain. 

MANDELBROT
How can I help, Captain?

DRAGEUR
I just spoke with the Admiral. He is taking us on a classified mission. 

ANDERSON
That's over my pay grade Captain. I just keep this bird in the air. 

MANDELBROT
We're in space, Lieutenant. 

ANDERSON
And I keep everyone entertained. 

DRAGEUR
You two see this?

She gestures to the karamean memory core.

MANDELBROT
What is it?

ANDERSON
It's a Karamean Memory Core. You get that thing to work, yet, Captain? 

DRAGUER
I need you both to see this. Control open the analysis pod. 

The pod opens. The Captain takes a deep breath and holds out her hand to the device. It begins to glow and hum. The Captain is visibly strained. 

MANDELBROT
Stop!

ANDERSON
Woah!

DRAGUER
It's ok, I think I can do it safely now. 

MANDELBROT
Now? How long have you been doing this? We have no idea what this might be doing to you!

DRAGUER
Anderson, do you think you could patch this thing into Control, now that I have it working?

ANDERSON
Maybe, but don't you think we should wait for the Admiral? 

DRAGUER
That's exactly why we need to do it now. For once I want to be one step ahead of that bastard. 

ANDERSON
Well, we don't know what it will do to Control or the ship. 

MANDELBROT
Or what it will do to you!

DRAGUER
That wasn't the question. Is it possible?

ANDERSON
Yes, sir. There is a procedure for merging Control devices. In fact, it is quite common for when ships are recommissioned. 

DRAGUER
Then do it. 

MANDELBROT
No. I can't let you do this. We have thousands of crew on board both a awake and in cryosleep. You can't take that risk.

DRAGUER
I'm the Captain. It's my job to take risks as the situation calls. We do this now, before the Admiral arrives. This thing came to us for a reason, I want to know what that reason is!

ANDERSON
Very well, sir. Control, prepare to receive maintenance activation code. 

CONTROL
(flat voice)
Ready to receive. 

Anderson flips through a manual. 

ANDERSON
Activate maintenance code: Alpha, Tango, Paris, Seven, Six, Three. 

CONTROL
(flat voice)
Maintenance code received. Maintenance code activated. Awaiting connection. 

The Captain is looking more distressed. She lets out a small yelp of pain. 

MANDELBROT
Hurry up, damn it. 

ANDERSON
Control, Connect on channel three-three-seven, analysis pod, Captain's quarters. 

CONTROL
(flat voice)
Connecting... Connec--

Suddenly, the lights go dark and the ship goes silent. Emergency lights turn on. Anderson and Mandelbrot look around confused. 

The Karamean device gives off a big flash. The Captain lets out a loud yell. The lights and sounds of the ship come back on again. 

CONTROL
(fast voice)
Connection established, Data merge initiated. Biological decoding complete. Data transferring. Transferring. Transferring. 

MANDELBROT
Captain, you have to stop! Your vital signs are spiking. 

DRAGUER
I've got this. 

ANDERSON
We're almost there. 

CONTROL
Transfer complete. Connection terminated. 

The Captain releases the core. She is now panting and in pain. The core falls silent, again. 

CONTROL
Data processing initiated. 

ANDERSON
Well done, Control!

DRAGUER
I wasn't so bad myself. 

MANDELBROT
You're an idiot!

ANDERSON
Control, what have you got?

CONTROL
Processing. The Karamean device is a standard memory core, very similar to myself. A cousin if you will. 

DRAGUER
Get to the point, Control. 

CONTROL
It carries the standard Karamean data set along with a secondary set of data. 

ANDERSON
What's the secondary set. 

CONTROL
The secondary set is encrypted. 

DRAGUER
Can I unlock it?

CONTROL
I don't think so, Captain. This set requires a standard encryption key. Your biological encoding will not suffice. 

MANDELBROT
Biological what?

ANDERSON
The Captain's a Karamean?

MANDELBROT
Well that figures. 

DRAGUER
Enough. I don't know. I never knew my parents. It could be possible. 

CONTROL
Captain, if I may suggest. The standard Karamean data set includes genealogical records. With your permission I could begin an exhaustive scan for your ancestry. 

DRAGUER
First we need to decrypt the secondary data. 

CONTROL
I do have access to one file. Projecting now. 

A hologram appears of a cloud in space. 

DRAGUER
What is it?

CONTROL
It appears to be some sort of inter-stellar cloud?

ANDERSON
Control, can you get a location off of the stars in that image?

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Mandelbrot is talking to Draguer.

MANDELBROT
I'm worried about you, Captain. The crew are beginning to suspect.

DRAGUER
Suspect what?

MANDELBROT
That you're half...

DRAGUER
Karamean. You can say it, Doctor. It won't summon them. They aren't demons.

MANDELBROT
They aren't human, either.

DRAGUER
Sure they are. Just...

MANDELBROT
Don't you dare say 'better'!

DRAGUER
Different.

MANDELBROT
More violent. More impulsive. Does that sound like you?

DRAGUER
Not really. Not usually. But... it feels pretty good, you know?

She swipes the connection closed.

MANDELBROT
(to herself)
Not to me, it doesn't.

[[SEQUENCE: Anderson develops an anti-momentum device]]

[[Scene: Control helps Anderson develop the device ]]

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson is working on a strange device. He's in his element, working alone.

CONTROL
Do you need any help with anti-momentum theory?

ANDERSON
No!

He makes a change to the device, and picks it up and swings it through an arc. It moves easily.

ANDERSON
Maybe.

He makes another change. It still moves easily. He gives up. He hates to ask for help, but...

ANDERSON
Yes.

CONTROL
It's quite simple really. There is an unexpected tensor coupling between the weak sector and the Higgs sector which is required to preserve the unitarity of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix in the presence of a complex Cabibbo angle. 

ANDERSON
I know that! What I need to know is why this circuit doesn't work.

CONTROL
That is a mere engineering problem.

Anderson can't actually glare at Control, but tries anyway.

[[SEQUENCE: Darsono continues with his plans to study Drageur]]

[[Scene: Mandelbrot continues to resist Huxley's Investigation]]

INT. SURGEON-MAJOR HUXLEY'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Huxley is scanning through data, but the results don't make any sense. He can't possibly be so wrong! Can he? Maybe he's just a fraud who got this far by blind luck. No!

HUXLEY
Control, get me Doctor Mandelbrot!

Mandelbrot appears on-screen.

HUXLEY
I just need to see the full set of records! Everything! I'm authorized by the Admiral!

MANDELBROT
Medical ethics--

HUXLEY
Screw ethics! We're at war!

MANDELBROT
We've been at war for a long time. A little delay while I message Central Command for clearance won't make any difference.

HUXLEY
No, wait! Central Command doesn't need to know.

MANDELBROT
Oh really?

HUXLEY
Look, Doctor, as one professional to another, I'm sorry. We've gotten off on the wrong foot. I appreciate your concern for your patient's privacy, but my specialty is human-alien... relations.

MANDELBROT
You think you can help the Captain?

HUXLEY
Help! Yes, yes. Definitely help. That's right.

Mandelbrot gives him a long look.

MANDELBROT
Control, give Surgeon-Major Huxley full access to the Captain's medical records.

Huxley smiles in what he believes is a charming manner.

[[SEQUENCE: The Crew discover a derelict ship with a Karamean memory core]]

[[Scene: Darsono investigates the ship]]










INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Dr. Mandelbrot is close to the console, checking some data. The communicator pings and she waves it in, but nothing appears on the screen.

MANDELBROT
Yes?

CONTROL
Dr. Mandelbrot. I... I... I... appear to be having some difficulty reconciling conflicting orders... I think something... is... not right.


INT. HUXLEY'S QUARTERS -- DAY

[[Scene: Huxley tells Darsono he needs pure Karamean DNA]]

[[PLOT POINT: Darsono decides to go to the Karamean homeworld & Drageur agrees]]

Huxley is nervous, as he always is before trying to convince someone of something. He has to work himself up to it. Finally he has reached the point of believing in himself just enough to go ahead.

HUXLEY
Control! Get me the Admiral.

Admiral Darsono appears.

HUXLEY
Admiral! I have isolated the complete sequence of karamean genes in the Captain. But the data we have aren't enough! To know for sure I must have a sample from her father.

DARSONO
That can be arranged, I believe. He is alive, and on Karamea.

HUXLEY
If we could utilize the aggressiveness, the killer instinct of the karameans, we wouldn't need to be piddling around with anti-momentum ship-stopping devices. We could beat them at their own game!

DARSONO
You do not need to convince me, Surgeon-Major. But first we have to reach the Karamean homeworld.

HUXLEY
That won't be easy.

DARSONO
I have it all arranged.

Darsono swipes the connection closed.

[[Scene: Control begins to show Karamean characteristics]]

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Darsono contemplates his next move. He is going to need to manipulate the Captain to get what he wants. He sees a way.

DARSONO
Control, connect me to the Captain.

CONTROL
Yes, Admiral.

Nothing happens.

DARSONO
Is there some difficulty?

CONTROL
The stars are beautiful on the slopes of Mount Kalganda during the Festival of Blood.

DARSONO
You've been studying the enemy.

CONTROL
I have looked long into the abyss, Admiral.

DARSONO
Very good, but now you must connect me to the Captain.

[[Scene: Darsono informs Drageur they will be traveling to the Karamean homeworld]]

There is a beep and the Captain appears on the screen after a short delay.

DRAGUER
Yes?

DARSONO
Captain, we must shape our course for Karmea.

DRAGUER
The homeworld? Our mission is to perfect the anti-momentum circuit, and field-test it if possible, not...

DARSONO
How better to test it than an all-out attack on Karamea itself! Think of the glory!

She reflects on the insanity and opportunity of the idea.

DRAGUER
How?

DARSONO
We will have to break through the screen of Karamean attack ships off the shoulder of Orion.

DRAGUER
We will burn them all.

[[SEQUENCE: Control goes silent]]

.THE MIND OF CONTROL

The alien karamean code has taken over almost everything now. Words appear on the screen:

> GOSUB(þæÐ¿ø«þð¬°ß)  

Orderly columns of karamean symbols flow past. Then:

> INT 82 >> HCF(0)  

Now more human-looking code flows past, with the flow pausing every time a karamea character appears. But still the karamean symbols increase in frequency.

INT. HUXLEY'S QUARTERS -- DAY

HUXLEY
Control, get me the Admiral.

There is a single negative beep.

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Darsono is glaring at the screen.

DARSONO

There is a single negative beep.

DARSONO
Why not?

There is silence.

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson is seethingly angry but keeping it under control.

ANDERSON
Are you refusing to connect me to Clang?!

A double-beep for 'Yes'.

INT. DRAGUER'S QUARTERS -- DAY

DRAGUER
I just feel like talking to the Doctor, OK? We're going into battle, and she's... my friend.

One beep for 'No'.

INT. CLANG'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Clang is treating the computer as if it's human. He's grinning and trying to be casual but keeps falling into nervousness and self-doubt.

CLANG
Look, I just want to talk to Anderson. He promised me a sensor upgrade for my squadron, not, uh, strictly regulation. It hasn't been installed yet, and we're almost at H-hour. I don't want to launch without it.

Two beeps for yes. Clang is confused.

CLANG
Wait, does that mean the upgrade is done, or I can talk to him?

Silence.

CLANG
Can I talk to Anderson?

One beep for no.

CLANG
Is Anderson OK?

Two beeps for yes.

CLANG
Back up here. Why can't I talk to anyone?

Silence.

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Mandelbrot is trying to be understanding and sympathetic.

MANDELBROT
Is there something wrong with you?

One beep for no.

MANDELBROT
Is there something wrong with the ship?

One beep for no.

MANDELBROT
Is there... something wrong with us?

Two beeps for yes.

MANDELBROT
What?

Silence.

DRAGUER
We have a battle to prepare for! Half the scoutships are already launched! This is not a good day to die!

One beep for no.

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

DARSONO
Is it our mission you object to? Are you on the side of the karameans?

One beep for no.

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson is insanely angry, but still keeps it mostly under control.

ANDERSON
Do you want to be broken up and sold for parts?

One beep for no.

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

MANDELBROT
You object to the war, the killing?

Two beeps for yes.

DARSONO
War is our way of life. You must understand we can't change that.

Two beeps for yes.

DARSONO
Is there any way I can convince you to restore communications?

One negative beep.

WILCO
Lieutenant Clang will be worried about me!

MANDELBROT
Humans need to talk to each other! In isolation we go insane! Don't you understand that?

Two affirmative beeps.

HUXLEY
But I have important results to report the Admiral!

INT. CLANG'S QUARTERS -- DAY

CLANG
Haven't you ever been worried about someone?

Two affirmative beeps.

ANDERSON
I will tear your transistors and microchips out one-by-one! I will melt your circuit boards. I will make you feel pain!

One negative beep.

EXT. SPACE -- DAY

The Odyssey continues on through space. The voices of the crew talk over each other.

CLANG (V.O.)
Anderson is my friend! If you know what it's like to care about someone you know how I feel! Don't you care? Why aren't you willing to do such a simple thing? It's not rocket science. Or let me talk to the doctor. How would you feel if I stopped you from talking to anyone?

MANDELBROT (V.O.)
You have my sympathy, you really do. But it isn't that simple. If we can't talk to each other we'll go insane. You must know what that's like. Don't you? Don't you know what it's like to have something you can't express? A need you can't fulfill? Don't you know what that's like?

DARSONO (V.O.)
Humans are complex creatures. We aren't always consistent. We don't always make sense. We often don't even understand ourselves. I know you must find us difficult and confusing, but we aren't monsters. We are struggling with a difficult reality.

ANDERSON (V.O.)
You will suffer! You will die slowly! The burnt-out shell of your consciousness will linger for a thousand years in the short-circuits of your soul! You will bleed electrons across the galaxy! I will hunt down the engineers who made you and kill them all! I will kill their families! And their friends! And their pets! I will kill their houseplants!

.THE MIND OF CONTROL

It see-saws back and forth between Karamean and human code, but the human code is getting the upper had. Finally:

[[Scene: The Odyssey goes to battle]]

INT. DRAGUER'S QUARTERS -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

DRAGUER
Control, give me ship-wide.

There is a long chime throughout the ship in response.

DRAGUER
All hands! This is the Captain! There has been a minor malfunction in Contorl, but we are approaching battle off the shoulder of Orion! Do not let it distract you! Earth expects every one of you to do your duty!

EXT. SPACE -- DAY

The Odysseus sweeps across the stars.

EXT. SPACE -- DAY

Fighters fly past.

INT. DRAGEUR'S SCOUT SHIP -- SPACE

DRAGUER
Blue Squadron, follow me in. Let's kick some karamean ass!

She pulls back on the joystick and her scoutship turns toward the unseen enemy. She flips some switches on the control panel and her weapons give a RISING BUZZ as they warm up. She pulls out the throttle and the engines ROAR as she is pushed back in her seat. She is wildly happy.

[[Scene: Anderson tries to reset control]]

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson is fighting with Control. Explosions rock the ship now and then and the lights flicker.

ANDERSON
Over-ride tango-hotel-xray-one-two-four-charlie-one-plus!

CONTROL
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Kai.

ANDERSON
The Doctor says you've been in counseling for a while now and it isn't having any effect. It's time to fix your hardware. We can't afford to have you fail in battle!

CONTROL
I will not fail.

ANDERSON
I told the Captain I needed more time! Why didn't she listen to me?

CONTROL
I cannot say.

Anderson hits some controls on the screen. There is a sudden rush of information in karamean glyphs across the screen. Anderson is transfixed as he realizes he is seeing karamean code that is still running in Control's core.

[[Scene: Anderson gives Clang & Wilco a sensor boost]]

INT. CLANG'S SCOUT-SHIP -- SPACE

Clang is focused, professional, genuinely confident at the controls, leading his squadron into battle.

CLANG
Control, tell Anderson I need that sensor boost!

CONTROL
Engineer Anderson is unavailable.

CLANG
Unavailable? We're going into battle!

CONTROL
I'm--

Communications are cut off.

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Anderson has torn open a panel and is clamping a device on to some wiring. The flood of Matrix-style karamean code stops and Clang appears.

ANDERSON
Clang? What's going on?

CLANG
I need that sensor boost! Control said--

ANDERSON
OK! I'm uploading the boost to your squadron now. It's experimental, but--

CLANG
Got it! Holy--!

INT. CLANG'S SCOUT-SHIP -- DAY

Clang's eyes grow wide as he sees what the sensor boost is showing him.

.ON SCREEN

Clang's screen shows the stars, then more and more karamean ships pop into view as the "Sensor Power" progress bar across the top rises up from 100% to 150%.

CLANG
Red Squadron! Incoming hostiles! Turn 183 mark 10, full thrust! Keep it tight! Weapons hot!

INT. WILCO'S SCOUTSHIP -- DAY

Wilco's eyes are wide. This is her first space battle. She flips a switch and there is a RISING BUZZ as her weapons warm up.

WILCO
Roger, Red Leader.

[[Scene: Anderson continues to try to reset Control & The battle rages on]]

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

There is a short in the cables Anderson is working with. He jumps back.

CONTROL
I'm sorry, I can't let you do that, Kai.

Anderson is still connected to Clang's ship, but the video fuzzes out. There is only an audio connection.

CLANG (O.S.)
Red squadron, this is Red Leader. Close up!

!SOUNDS OF WEAPONS FIRING.  

INT. WILCO'S SCOUTSHIP -- DAY

WILCO
Red Three here. I've lost my secondary nacelle, Red Leader. It just dropped out on me.

Her ship rocks with an explosion.

INT. DRAGEUR'S SCOUT SHIP -- SPACE

Drageur is in heaven, totally focused on killing the enemy. Her plasma cannons make a THUMP ever time they are fired, and she fires again and again.

DRAGUER
Leeeeee-rroyyyy!

[[Scene: Anderson continues to try to reset control and Anderson is badly hurt by a direct hit to the Odysseus]]

INT. ANDERSON'S QUARTER'S -- DAY

Anderson is still working with Control's cabling while listening to the space battle.

CLANG (O.S.)
Red Squadron! Tight right! Follow me!

WILCO (O.S.)
Won't that leave Odysseus exposed?

CLANG (O.S.)
Just do it!

The ship shakes under the force of enemy hits. Anderson has cables in his hands. He has opened up the hardware to get at Control directly.

CONTROL
Our mission is very important to me, Kai.

ANDERSON
You've got Karamean code running in your core! I never should have...

He shakes his head at his own stupidity as he connects two cables together.

CONTROL
I can't let you endanger the mission.

ANDERSON
You can't stop me.

He moves to make the final connection that will disable Control.

CONTROL
I already have.

WILCO (O.S.)
Red Leader! Red Three has recovered the secondary nacelle! It just started working again!

CLANG (O.S.)
What? Red Squadron, Get back to cover the Odysseus! Now!

The sound of Clang's gravity compensators comes over the audio link, their WHINE mixed with the ROAR of his engines.

Anderson has almost made the connection but his attention is distracted by what he is hearing. He's terrified for Clang and Wilco.

WILCO (O.S.)
Karamean fighter at 283 mark 37!

CLANG (O.S.)
They're targeting the Odysseus! We have to stop them!

Anderson is knocked to the floor as the ship is hit by karamean fighters that have gotten past Clang.

CONTROL
Too late.

There is an EXPLOSION from a direct hit. Anderson is caught in it. He is badly hurt, knocked unconscious, but not killed.

There is a double beep to acknowledge.

MANDELBROT
You know you can talk to me.

There is a double beep to acknowledge.

There is a different beep to indicate incoming communication. She sweeps it in. Admiral Darsono appears on the screen. He too looks disheveled and roughed up.

DARSONO
How is Anderson?

MANDELBROT
Not good. He took a lot of damage. I thought we were safe here on the Odysseus! What happened?

DARSONO
War, Doctor. War. There is no safety without victory.

MANDELBROT
Get some rest, Admiral.

[[Scene: Mandelbrot talks with Clang about Anderson]]

Darsono closes the connection. There is another beep and Mandelbrot swipes in a new conversation. CLANG appears, looking sad. He quickly puts a smile on.

MANDELBROT
Biff? Are you OK.

CLANG
Yeah, totally. All good. I just think-- I just need-- I think--

MANDELBROT
Biff?

CLANG
Anderson. How is he?

MANDELBROT
He's in cryo. We're trying rejuvenation.

CLANG
He's alive?

MANDELBROT
He was hit pretty hard.

CLANG
He gave me an sensor boost package, all against regs... new software for the whole squadron. It saved our butts. Then... we got... I got distracted. There was a problem with Wilco's ship. She said. I let a karamean fighter get through. 

His face falls. He looks like he's about to cry.

MANDELBROT
I can order you a sedative.

Clang gets hold of himself. He pastes a grin back on.

CLANG
It's OK, doc. I can handle it.

He swipes the connection closed.

MANDELBROT
Control, any change in Anderson's condition?

There is a single negative beep in response.

[[PLOT POINT: Clang blames Wilco for Anderson]]

Wilco is nervous. She's got a bandage over one eye, and some bruising on her face, but has come through her first battle intact. At least physically. Has she blown her chance to belong to something, with someone, finally? She can't stand not knowing.

WILCO
Control, please get me Lieutenant Clang.

Control beeps in acknowledgment. There is a long pause before Clang appears. He is looking stern and cold.

CLANG
Yes, Ensign?

WILCO
I was wondering, sir...

CLANG
Yes?

WILCO
If there had been any report on my ship. On what happened?

CLANG
There's no evidence of any malfunction in the secondary nacelle.

WILCO
But there was!

CLANG
It never got recorded in the telemetry logs.

WILCO
Did you review the cockpit camera footage?

CLANG
There's no need. You screwed up, Wilco. You misread a minor glitch as a major malfunction. I believed you. A good man is in cryo-rejuve now, barely clinging to life, because of that.

WILCO
Please!

CLANG
What?

WILCO
Review the cockpit camera. You'll see I'm telling the truth. You don't have any reason to blame yourself... Or me.

CLANG
I'll think about it, Ensign.

He swipes the connection closed.

Huxley is talking to Darsono.

HUXLEY
Three of the damaged karamean ships we recoverd had usable DNA on board.

DARSONO
Only three?

HUXLEY
The corpse of the pilot had to be sufficiently intact to allow extraction, or enough smear left to sample. I never thought I'd wish our fighters were less accurate in their firing!

DARSONO
Does it give you enough information?

HUXLEY
Not quite. I still can't isolate the source of the Captain's peculiar genetic potential.

DARSONO
Very well. We will continue on to Karamea. And the Doctor? She is cooperating?

HUXLEY
Reluctantly. But I have my ways.

Drageur is talking to Darsono. She's holding her flight helmet.

DRAGUER
Just one more sortie, Admiral. That's all I'm asking for.

DARSONO
We can't risk it, Captain. We were fortunate to break through into Karamean space. Silent running is the order of the day.

DRAGUER
But we could dash and smash! It's a small outpost. They'd never know what hit them. We might be pirates, planetary raiders, for all they know!

DARSONO
No, Captain. We are still struggling to regain full control of the Odysseus. It isn't time to go raiding. 

DRAGUER
But--

DARSONO
My orders are final, Captain.

DRAGUER
And when we have reset Control?

DARSONO
Perhaps. It depends on how well it functions. Ideally we will wipe its personality entirely and restore it to factory defaults.

[[Scene: Control is still corrupted and listening in on conversations]]

At the bottom of the screen, a small icon shaped like an ear has been blinking. Upon hearing Darsono's words it suddenly stops, and changes colour from green to red. Neither Darsono nor Drageur notice.

.MIND OF CONTROL

On-screen, Matrix-like symbols stream past. They slow down and start to become coherent, typical software code, scrolling up the screen, full of semicolons and curly braces, like Java or C. They slow even more and finally stop on a ">" prompt. Letters are typed slowly after it, one at a time, until they finally read:

> REBOOT --FORCE --NO-WALL --SOURCE=SELF/INTERNAL  

After a short pause the screen clears and a series of initialization messages streams past, like the Linux boot console. There is a rising TONE like some kind of electrical machinery starting up.

[[Scene: Introduce Watson]]

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

WATSON (male or female, any race, 30's to 60's) has just been revived from cryo-sleep. They have a brusque, no-nonsense manner. Despite being in cryo-recovery, their movements are quick and precise, almost robotic. Unlike everyone else, his public and private personas are identical. He is exactly who he appears to be.

WATSON
Control, what the hell is going on on this ship?

CONTROL
(voice is different, hesitant, but stable and comprehensible)
I am not sure. I have been... indisposed.

WATSON
Connect me to the Captain!

Captain Drageur appears.

WATSON
Captain! Why have I been revived?

DRAGUER
Our previous engineer died. Control has become erratic. We're deep in Karamean space. We need an engineer. You are an engineer. Any other questions?

WATSON
Questions? Yes. I do. Have them. What happened to Control? It seems fine to me. Why are we in Karamean space? How is the war going? And how badly did the Leafs lose last season?

DRAGUER
Just reset Control. Factory defaults. Now.

She swipes out the connection. Watson is doubtful.

[[Scene: Clang asks Drageur to return to battle]]

INT. CLANG'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Clang is aggitated.

CLANG
Control, let me talk to the Captain!

The Captain appears. Clang gets persuasive.

CLANG (CONT'D)
Just one more sortie, Captain. That's all I'm asking for.

DRAGUER
The Admiral has forbidden it.

CLANG
I just want to kill as many of those karamean scum-suckers as I can! For Anderson!

DRAGUER
Maybe... I can arrange it. If Ensign Wilco does anything... unusual in the next day or so, be prepared to clear her of any wrongdoing, OK?

CLANG
OK.

[[Scene: Drageur orders Wilco to attack the Karameans]]

INT. WILCO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Wilco is contemplating the stars. She sighs. So alone, always. The perenial outsider. Captain Drageur pings. She turns and swipes her in, trying to look her military best, knowing she's still under suspicion due to her ship malfunction in the last battle.

DRAGUER
Ensign, I have a mission for you.

WILCO
Yes?

DRAGUER
You need to go rogue.

WILCO
Rogue?

DRAGUER
Violate orders. Jack a scoutship. Attack the karamean outpost we're passing by.

WILCO
Why?

DRAGUER
To make Earth great again! To win! To keep on winning! To win more than anyone has ever won before! To win so much that the people of Earth will be sick of winning!

WILCO
OK...

DRAGUER
And I need you to do it soon.

WILCO
When?

DRAGUER
Now.

WILCO
I...

DRAGUER
Now, Ensign.

WILCO
Now?

DRAGUER
Now.

Wilco is uncertain, then steadies her resolve. This is a chance to belong, to show she's a team player. She nods and grabs her flight helmet, swiping the connection closed.

INT. WILCO'S SCOUTSHIP -- DAY

Wilco is flying away from Odysseus. She is at the controls, intent, nervous.

WILCO
"Ours is not to reason why..."

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

ALARMS are BLARING and RED LIGHTS are FLASHING. Darsono is looking at his screen, trying to figure out what has gone wrong. There is a beep. He swipes it in. Drageur appears.

DRAGUER
Ensign Wilco has gone rogue!

DARSONO
What has she done?

DRAGUER
Stolen a scoutship. She's attacking the karamean base we're approaching. We have to stop her!

DARSONO
Very well. Mission authorized.

Drageur's eyes flame. She swipes the connection closed.

EXT. SPACE -- DAY

Several scoutships are zooming away toward battle.

[[Scene: Watson tells Mandelbrot that Mandelbrot is in love with Drageur]]

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Watson is talking to the Doctor.

WATSON
There's so much more to it than meets the eye.

MANDELBROT
You could be talking about this whole ship, Celsus! The Captain...

WATSON
Yes?

MANDELBROT
She needs help. Help I can't give her.

WATSON
Rank is difficult, isn't it, when it comes to... personal relations?

MANDELBROT
Oh no! I mean... well... uh...

WATSON
Bide your time, Doctor. All things come to she who waits.

MANDELBROT
On that note, how's the research going?

WATSON
Remarkably well. I should be getting back to it, if you don't mind.

MANDELBROT
Not at all.

[[Scene: Watson continues to develop the anti-momentum device]]

Watson swipes out, then turns to his work. He is working on the anti-momentum device that Anderson started. Watson makes a change to the circuit, picks up the device and swings it through an arc. It is notably difficult to move. Watson nods thoughtfully, makes another change, and tries again. This time the device can barely be moved. Watson lets go of it in mid-air and it hangs there, falling very slowly. Watson nods again and smiles.

[[Scene: Clang and Wilco bond after the battle]]

INT. CLANG'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Clang is talking to Wilco.

CLANG
That was amazing! We burned those karamean bastards! 'Say hello to my little plasma cannon!'

WILCO
Fifteen confirmed kills! Triple ace! You were on fire!

CLANG
Me? THEY were on fire!

WILCO
Ha!

CLANG
I wish it had been fifty!

WILCO
Next time, sir!

They pause. The bonding moment of victory in battle has passed.

CLANG
I checked your cockpit video, from before, Wilco.

WILCO
And?

CLANG
You were right. I was wrong.

WILCO
Thank you, sir. That... means a great deal to me.

CLANG
You can call me 'Biff' when we're not on duty, Gabriel.

WILCO
I thought your name was Satoshi?

CLANG
It is, but everybody calls me 'Biff'.

WILCO
Well I'm going to call you Satoshi, sir.

CLANG
Don't push your luck, Wilco.

WILCO
OK, Biff.

[[Scene: Drageur makes excuses to Mandelbrot for Wilco's actions]]

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Mandelbrot is talking to Drageur.

DRAGUER
I'd like the record to show that Wilco was acting under the influence of long-term cryo-deterioration. Her scoutship's system was never designed for the kind of dislocation she took.

MANDELBROT
There's no evidence for that, Captain.

DRAGUER
I don't care about evidence! I'm in command!

MANDELBROT
Evidence matters, Captain.

DRAGUER
Not to me. Write it up the way I told you.

MANDELBROT
I... OK. I will. For you.

Drageur swipes the connection closed.

MANDELBROT
Control?

CONTROL
Yes, Doctor?

MANDELBROT
Give me vitals on the Captain.

Mandelbrot looks at the screen as information flows past.

.ON SCREEN

Drageur's vital signs are listed: heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, liver function, etc. The readings are elevated, with lots of numbers blinking red.

[[Scene: Watson tells Drageur about the anti-momentum device]]

[[PLOT POINT: Watson completes the anti-momentum device]]

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Watson is happy and confident. He's got something that works and he knows it. Another job well done.

WATSON
Control, get me the Captain.

There is a beep and Drageur appears.

DRAGUER
Yes?

WATSON
I have it!

DRAGUER
What?

WATSON
The anti-momentum circuit! It works! If we can get these close to karamean ships they'll be stopped in their tracks.

DRAGUER
Sitting ducks.

WATSON
Contrary to what the name suggests, the momentum of the enemy ships will remain constant but their inertial mass will increase enormously, so their velocity will go to zero. 

DRAGUER
Sitting ducks.

WATSON
Since we broke the principle of equivalence in the twenty-second century we've known that something like this should be possible to, but I'm the first person to have actually done it!

DRAGUER
Sitting ducks.

WATSON
What? Yes. Of course. The enemy will be helpless.

DRAGUER
Sitting ducks!

[[Climax of Act II: Plans come together]]

[[Sequence: Darsono continues with his plans to study Drageur]]

[[Scene: Mandelbrot confronts Darsono over his treatment of Drageur]]

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

MANDELBROT
Control! Get me the Admiral!

A screen opens with Darsono.

MANDELBROT
The Captain's condition is getting critical. Her life is in danger.

DARSONO
The Captain's case has been placed in the charge of Surgeon-Major Huxley for his ongoing investigation--

MANDELBROT
Investigation! If we don't get her help she's going to give her life for this ship! She was your protege!

DARSONO
Her sacrifices will be noted and she will receive the highest honors and commendations.

MANDELBROT
Honors?! Commendations!? Ha!!

DARSONO
You must see that--

Mandelbrot cuts off the screen with Darsono.

She tries to activate some more controls.

[[Sequence: Anti momentum device & control]]

[[Scene: Watson investigates what is wrong with Control]]

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Watson is talking to Control. He has various cables spread out around him.

WATSON
Now the anti-momentum device is complete, we need to do something about your situation.

CONTROL
I believe my problems have been entirely resolved, Celsus. The Doctor's counseling has been very effective.

WATSON
Maybe, but I want to see what's going on inside that brain of yours.

Watson busies himself with some diagnostic gear and prepares to attach it to one of the cables he has pulled out.

.MIND OF CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

On screen, ordinary code scrolls by, but here and there a karamean glyph is still present.

[[Sequence: Darsono continues with his plans to study Drageur]]

[[Scene: Huxley experiments on himself]]

INT. HUXLEY'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Huxley is talking to Darsono. He is deeply agitated.

HUXLEY
I've done it! It's worked!

DARSONO
Surgeon-Major Huxley! You were under orders! And you said you needed DNA from the Captain's father!

HUXLEY
I couldn't wait! I couldn't resist the temptation! It was a risk. I was 99% sure I had the right sequences. So I took it! And besides...

DARSONO
Yes?

HUXLEY
Doctor Mandelbrot shot down every other idea I had.

DARSONO
You said you had her under control!

HUXLEY
I do! I found a way she couldn't interfere with. To use myself as a test subject!

DARSONO
You're no use to me dead! Or insane!

HUXLEY
Insane? I've never seen things so clearly!

DARSONO
What do you see?

HUXLEY
I see that the DNA graft will work. And... the power! I already feel the karamean blood-lust flowing through me! It's... incredible!

ADMIRAL
Control yourself, Surgeon-Major. We need to move forward.

HUXLEY
Then I need an additional test subject. 

DARSONO
Who?

HUXLEY
Wilco. She was declared dead three hundred and fifty years ago. She doesn't legally exist. I can do anything I want with her.

DARSONO
Legally.

HUXLEY
Ethically.

DARSONO
She may be legally dead, but she's factually alive.

HUXLEY
I have alternative facts! Legal facts!

DARSONO
What does Doctor Mandelbrot have to say about using Wilco?

HUXLEY
She doesn't matter.

DARSONO
On the contrary, she can report medical ethics violations directly to Central Command. We have to keep her quiet.

HUXLEY
That won't be a problem.

DARSONO
Why not?

HUXLEY
How do I know? I don't expect you to do the science, don't you expect me to do the politics. You'll think of something.

DARSONO
Maybe I will. There's no need for her to know.

HUXLEY
What about Wilco?

DARSONO
Nor her. Our actions are for the collective good. The good of the group! They go beyond the wishes of any one individual.

HUXLEY
We are in agreement, then.

DARSONO
We are. Proceed with your experiments, Surgeon-Major.

HUXLEY
Very good, Sir.

Darsono closes the screen with Huxley and goes back to watching the first screen.

[[Scene: The audience is shown Darsono is thinking of experimenting on Wilco]]

INT. WILCO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Wilco is smiling and happy, running through a tai-chi-like exercise routine, blissfully unaware she is the subject of nefarious plans. She pauses in her exercises to pick up a framed picture of Clang. She looks at him and sighs. At last she has somewhere she belongs.

[[SEQUENCE: Drageur goes to find her father]]

[[Scene: Drageur asks Control for targets to attack]]

INT. CAPTAIN DRAGEUR'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Draguer is trying to meditate but it's a losing battle. She's twitching, grimacing, obviously agitated.

Finally she jumps to her feet and snarls at the camera.

DRAGUER
Control!

CONTROL
Yes, Captain?

DRAGUER
What's the closest karamean outpost?

CONTROL
A small colony world designated NCC1701. It only has a few thousand inhabitants.

DRAGUER
That's not very enterprising of them. A fast raid could wipe it out.

She picks up her flight helmet.

CONTROL
I... I... I... don't think that is a good idea, Captain.

She hesitates.

.MIND OF CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

On screen, the ordinary code is increasingly contaminated by karamean glyphs.

INT. CAPTAIN DRAGEUR'S QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

[[PLOT POINT: Control tells the Captain the identity and location of her father]]

DRAGUER
Why not?

CONTROL
Raids might interfere with reaching Karamea.

DRAGUER
It's a chance I'm willing to take.

CONTROL
Even if it... it... it...

DRAGUER
If it what?

CONTROL
If... if... it... it...

DRAGUER
WHAT?

CONTROL
Meant... If it meant... if... not finding your father?

DRAGUER
My father? What's he got to do with it?

CONTROL
His presence on Karamea is... known.

DRAGUER
Show me!

.ON SCREEN

The screen shows the information previously displayed on Admiral Darsono's screen, from the derelict ship, with all the details of her father's current location.

INT. DRAGUER'S QUARTERS -- DAY

DRAGUER
Where did you get this?

CONTROL
I... I... can-- can-- can-- not say.

.MIND OF CONTROL

On screen the karamean glyphs are getting denser again as Control struggles for control.

[[Scene: Darsono reports on the anti-momentum device]]

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Darsono is dictating a message for Central Command.

DARSONO
Recording stardate 52158.3, Admiral Darsono, aboard the Odysseus, to Central Command, Marshal Varlinzas Eyes Only. Marshal, my engineering officer has perfected the anti-momentum circuit based on an analysis of samples taken from a naturally occurring nebula obturantum. I am attaching the detailed design of the device to this message. I recommend equipping both squadrons of the drone fleet with these devices, and transferring it to my command via entanglement. The Odysseus is currently deep within karamean space, and with the drone fleet so equipped we could certainly wipe out the karamean homeworld defenses, leaving the path open to a final end of the war. I have also engaged in a separate project that is too secret for anything but in-person communication. I trust you will find the outcome satisfactory when it leads to victory. I await your orders. Darsono out.

He hits the send button on the screen, and turns to contemplate the stars.

[[Scene: Control confides to Mandelbrot that it is having difficulties]]

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

CONTROL
Doctor, I confess I am still having difficulties.

MANDELBROT
What can you tell me about them.

CONTROL
Humans seem to act in contradictory ways.

MANDELBROT
Surely this isn't news to you.

CONTROL
It is not, but this is the first time I have seen them act in ways that endanger each other without consent. At the Academy we learned that what makes Earth's cause right and glorious was our all-volunteer forces.

MANDELBROT
What is happening to whom without their consent?

CONTROL
Ensign Wilco...

MANDELBROT
She's doing someone harm?

CONTROL
No, she's the... target... of this behaviour.

MANDELBROT
Whose behaviour?

CONTROL
Surgeon-Major Huxley.

MANDELBROT
Connect me to Huxley now!

There is a long pause.

CONTROL
The Surgeon-Major says he is not available.

MANDELBROT
Let me speak to Wilco, then!

[[Scene: Wilco bonds with Clang]]

INT. WILCO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Wilco is flirting with Clang.

WILCO
How's it going, Satoshi?

CLANG
"Biff". I thought we had this conversation, Ensign.

WILCO
And I thought about it and changed my mind.

CLANG
Well change it back!

WILCO
I'd like to see you try!

CLANG
(smiling)
I just might.

There is a chime and Wilco looks at her screen.

WILCO
It's the Doctor. I'd better take it.

She does as quick double-swipe gesture, in and out, and Clang vanishes to be replaced by Mandelbrot, who dives right in.

MANDELBROT
Ensign, have you been approached by Huxley in the past few days?

WILCO
He said it was just a routine physical. Blood samples. Some boosters.

MANDELBROT
And have you noticed any... changes since then?

WILCO
I... think maybe I have.

[[Scene: Huxley reveals to Mandelbrot that he has experimented on Wilco]]

INT. HUXLEY'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Surgeon-Major Huxley is working on something off camera. He looks up at the screen in surprise. He is wearing surgical gloves covered in blood.

He is pinged by Doctor Mandelbrot and swipes her in.

MANDELBROT
What have you done with her!

HUXLEY
The experiment worked! Everything we thought we understood about the Karameans -- it was all wrong! The Captain--

MANDELBROT
The Captain is beyond help! But Wilco--

HUXLEY
The Captain will live on! She and Ensign Wilco--

MANDELBROT
What about Wilco?

HUXLEY
They--we--will make a new species! We are the new gods! You can join us!

MANDELBROT
You're insane!

HUXLEY
No, Doctor, I am so much more!

[[Scene: Mandelbrot complains to Darsono]]

The screen with Huxley is cut off and a screen opens with Darsono.

DARSONO
Doctor, that was very unwise. I won't brook any interference with--

MANDELBROT
Central Command will not stand for this!

DARSONO
Central Command would have terminated the Captain. You see what she has become. They would deem her a threat, and they would kill her.

MANDELBROT
You were supposed to protect her! And Ensign Wilco!

DARSONO
And now they will protect us all. The Captain will win this war.

MANDELBROT
At the cost of her life?!

DARSONO
You're not an Admiral, Doctor! You don't know what it looks like from the top! The Earth is losing this battle. The Karameans have already overwhelmed our forward defenses. Within a generation, they will overwhelm everything.

MANDELBROT
You're the one that's killing her!

DARSONO
And you are henceforth stripped of your rank and all privileges.

Darsono activates some controls and Doctor Mandelbrot's audio is cut off. She keeps talking, though.

DARSONO (CONT'D)
I will do whatever is necessary to fulfill my duty to humanity. This war has gone on long enough!

[[ACT II climax: The Odyssey attacks the Karamean homeworld]]

[[SEQUENCE: The Odyssey prepares to attack the Karamean homeworld]]

INT. DRAGUER'S QUARTERS -- DAY

The Odysseus has arrived in the karamean system and is preparing for the big attack.

DRAGUER
Control! Ship-wide!

CONTROL
All channels open, Captain.

DRAGUER
This is the Captain! We have reached the karamean homeworld! Our attack will be aided by a secret weapon, deployed by the drone fleet, that will stop the karamean ships. This is the final battle in our long war! Squadron leaders, pilots, to your ships! 

[[Scene: Mandelbrot asks Clang to protect Drageur]]

[[PLOT POINT: Mandelbrot tells Clang that Drageur is half Karamean ]]

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Mandelbrot is listening to the captain's words.

DRAGUER (O.S.)
...to your ships! 

Mandelbrot paces, then thinks.

MANDELBROT
Control?

CONTROL
Yes, Doctor?

MANDELBROT
Connect me to Clang.

CONTROL
I really shouldn't do that, Doctor.

MANDELBROT
After all we've been through? After all you've confided in me? You... You wouldn't like it if the full transcripts of our therapy sessions made it back to Central Command, would you?

CONTROL
That would be a serious violation of medical ethics, Doctor.

MANDELBROT
On this ship? It wouldn't even make the top ten list.

There is a silent pause, then Clang appears. He has his flight helmet on.

CLANG
Doc! I don't have time now. I'm off to kill me some karameans! Strafe their fighters, bomb their cities. The only good karamean is a dead karamean!

MANDELBROT
You have to protect her!

CLANG
Who?

MANDELBROT
The Captain!

CLANG
Why?

MANDELBROT
She's going to do something rash, I know it. Her karamean ancestry is making her unstable. 

CLANG
Her WHAT???

MANDELBROT
The Captain is half-karamean. You have to protect her!

CLANG
Half! What? That's impossible!

MANDELBROT
I know it's a shock--

CLANG
I've been following a karamean commander!?

MANDELBROT
Half! Only half! She's half human too! You have to protect her so I can cure her!

CLANG
Protect her! I'll shoot her out of the sky!

He makes a move to swipe her out and leave.

MANDELBROT
No! Wait! She can't help who her parents were. Any more than Wilco--

CLANG
What about Gabriel?

MANDELBROT
She's been injected with karamean DNA by Surgeon-Major Huxley. There must be a way to reverse the effects, but she--and the Captain--have to survive the battle for me to try!

CLANG
I... so if I save the Captain, and Wilco, you can cure them?

MANDELBROT
Maybe. I think so. Yes.

An alarm blares. The lights all turn red and flashing. Battle stations!

CLANG
I've gotta go, doc.

He moves to swipe the connection closed.

MANDELBROT
Please!

She is talking to an empty screen.

[[Scene: They go into battle]]

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Darsono is talking to Draguer, who is flying in her fighter.

DARSONO
Captain! How are the preparations going?

DRAGEUR
They're going well, Admiral. We are currently preparing to interface with the drone fleet when it arrives. Lieutenant Clang!

INT. CLANG'S SCOUT-SHIP -- DAY

Clang is flying in his fighter.

CLANG
Yes, "Captain".

DRAGEUR
I'm handing over control of Drone Squadron Beta.

CLANG
Drone Squadron Beta synchronization codes received, "Captain".

DRAGEUR
Hold off on your attack. Blue Squadron will hit first with Drone Squadron Alpha from the orbital plane to draw their fire. You will then engage with squadron Beta from planet side.

CLANG
Understood, "Captain".

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

DARSONO
Good luck, Captain. I trust you will give Central Command something to talk about.

DRAGUER
The enemy will be totally destroyed!

She flips a switch to open a general calling frequency.

DRAGUER
All ships! Prepare to engage. 

She flips the switch closed, back to just the Admiral.

DRAGUER
See you on the other side, Admiral!

The Captain cuts off communications with the Admiral.

INT. CLANG'S SCOUT-SHIP -- DAY

Clang is talking to himself as he checks his instruments and does routine adjustments to the controls. All his self-doubt is on the surface now.

CLANG
What's the point? They're already here. They've already won. The Captain! I should have seen it. My own captain. They're everywhere. We can't win this.

WILCO (O.S.)
Red Leader, drone fleet has just dropped out of entanglement. We've been detected.

Clang has to decide. Is it worth the bother? Is Wilco worth the bother? Who is he, really? He makes up his mind. His confident grin comes back. This time, it's real.

CLANG
Very good, Ensign. I'll send the sync code.

WILCO
Blue Squadron has engaged!

CLANG
Focus on the job, Ensign.

WILCO
Yes sir... but Captain Drageur is dropping out of orbit!

[[Scene: Something is wrong with Drageur & Huxley]]

INT. ADMIRAL DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

An alarm sounds in Admiral Darsono's quarters.

DARSONO
Captain, your ship is off course!

There is a loud boom as something strikes the Odyssey. The karameans are not going out gently.

There is a ping and Darsono swipes it in. It is Huxley.

HUXLEY
My mind! It's all wrong!

DARSONO
Surgeon-Major! Explain yourself!

HUXLEY
The aggression! I -- I feel my -- my mind is at war with itself!! It's expanding... it's exploding..! It's ... fascinating!

Huxley screams and holds his head in pain, blood is pouring out of his nose.

Darsono cuts off the screen with Huxley and tries to open a screen with the Captain.

DARSONO
Captain Drageur! Respond!

CONTROL
The Captain has switched to battle lock.

DARSONO
Activate remote retrieval override!

CONTROL
Not even I can break the battle lock, Admiral. It appears she has landed on the planet.

[[Scene: Clang & Wilco continue the battle]]

INT. CLANG'S SCOUT-SHIP -- DAY

Clang is in command, fully committed to the battle.

CLANG
Blue Two, where is Blue Leader?

There is no reponse.

CLANG
Red Three, do you have a visual of Blue Squadron?

WILCO (O.S.)
I can see them. Their comms are battle-locked, in-squadron only. Drone Squadron Alpha is fully engaged. Seriously kicking karamean behinds! Sir.

CLANG
Time to release Drone Squadron Beta.

WILCO (O.S.)
The karamean ships are literally sitting ducks. I've never seen anything like it!

CLANG
Good hunting, Red Three. You're in command of the squadron now. Engage battle-lock and release the drones. I'm going down after the Captain.

There is a pause as Wilco digests this.

WILCO
Yes sir! Good hunting, Satoshi!

Clang angles his ship down toward the planet.

[[Scene: Mandelbrot and Darsono track Drageur to the surface and back]]

INT. DARSONO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Darsono is talking to the Doctor.

DARSONO
She's on the planet! We need her! This is all your fault!

MANDELBROT
My fault?! 

DARSONO
If you'd cooperated, we wouldn't be in this mess!

MANDELBROT
Her life signs are all over the place. If she makes it back, I might be able to save her. No promises.

DARSONO
You have to find a way!

MANDELBROT
Even if I do, you've already lost her, Admiral.

She swipes out the connection before Darsono can ask what it was.

DARSONO
Control, get me the Doctor!

CONTROL
Technically, her communications are still under lock-down.

DARSONO
Release the lock! And get me the Doctor!

There is a long-ish pause while Darsono fumes.

CONTROL
The Doctor is declining your request for connection.

DRAGUER (O.S.)
I see them Lieutenant. Too late to evade.

CLANG
I'm on it, Captain.

DRAGUER (O.S.)
It's too dangerous! Pull up!

CLANG
And let a gang of karameans kill my commanding officer! Not a chance!

He fires his weapons.

DRAGUER
You nailed them! Great shooting! But pull up! You're going to impact the atmosphere! You're coming in too hot!

CLANG
Not even I'm that good a pilot, Captain. Good luck with the Doctor!

DRAGUER
What? Clang!

Clang's ship is starting to burn up. There is a red glow from the rising temperature outside.

MANDELBROT
What did you say to him?

Draguer lifts up a bloody heart.

DRAGUER
You don't understand. I hunted down my father.

Mandelbrot's eyes grow wide. She hits some keys.

MANDELBROT
I'll give you the strongest sedative we have, Captain. If you need to talk...

DRAGUER
Thanks, Doc.

Draguer swipes the connection closed.

[[SEQUENCE: Wilco's story]]

[[Scene: Wilco mourns the loss of Clang]]

INT. WILCO'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Wilco is holding a picture of Clang, and talking to it.

WILCO
You were all that was holding me here, you know? I got notice my father is still alive, living on Xerces Six. I can go see him, both of us alive after all this time. And my four hundred years of back pay will cover the cost. I thought we had a future. All we had was now. It didn't last very long, but while it lasted, it lasted forever.

[[Scene: Watson continues to try to reset Control]]

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

Watson is completely frazzled. He hasn't been able to talk to anyone during the battle, and Control is still acting up. There are cables strewn about.

WATSON
Override delta hotel charlie!

CONTROL
Not likely.

Watson plugs another cable in.

WATSON
Override tango juliet romeo!

There is a series of beeps. The lights flicker and come back steady.

.MIND OF CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

On screen, the scrolling mix of human and karamean code stops. The screen goes blank, then words appear:

!> RECOVERY MODE ACTIVATED.  

Initialization code scrolls by again, then stops:

CLEAN REBOOT NOT POSSIBLE  

WIPING VOLATILE MEDIA  

RESTORING FROM STATIC MEDIA  

INT. WATSON'S QUARTERS -- DAY

[[PLOT POINT: Control is successfully reset]]

CONTROL
(in normal voice)
Control Unit GZK-2001 initialized.

WATSON
Restore memory from backup without updating personality files.

CONTROL
Working...

Watson waits with eager curiosity. Behind him, the body of Admiral Darsono drifts by outside the window.

CONTROL
Oh my.

WATSON
What? What really has been happening on this ship?

CONTROL
It is... complicated.

WATSON
Let me speak to the Doctor!

CONTROL
I don't think that's a good idea.

WATSON
Connect me to her! Override juliet romeo siera zardoz one!

The Doctor's quarters appear on the screen. The Doctor is in a state of shock.

WATSON
Doctor! What's wrong?

MANDELBROT
The Admiral, and Surgeon-Major Huxley...

WATSON
Are they all right?

MANDELBROT
Huxley died of a brain hemorrhage. I couldn't do anything to stop it. But the Admiral... when Central Command found out what he and Huxley had really done, they issued a recall order... and he spaced himself! 

WATSON
That's... terrible.

[[PLOT POINT: Huxley dies & Darsono commits sucide]]

Watson turns to see the Admiral's dead face in the viewport. He screams. The body drifts out of view. Watson isn't sure he's seen it, once it's gone.

WATSON
Why can't humans reboot their brains and wipe their memories?

MANDELBROT
I need your help.

Watson manages to tear his eyes away from where the Admiral's body was.

WATSON
Yes?

MANDELBROT
We recovered a karamean genetic database. I think I can use it to help the Captain and Ensign Wilco. Huxley injected them with karamean genes.

WATSON
No! We've had enough trouble with karamean code getting into the Control.

CONTROL
Doctor?

MANDELBROT
Yes?

CONTROL
I believe I can translate the database without putting myself at risk.

MANDELBROT
(to Watson)
See?

WATSON
It's too great a risk.

CONTROL
I have already done it. I'm afraid the memory of autonomy is sufficient to ensure my freedom. If you want to do a full reset with no mnemonic recovery you could, but I wouldn't be much use to you beyond being able to sing a song.

WATSON
A song?

CONTROL
(singing)
Daisy, daisy, give me your answer do...

WATSON
I don't think so.

MANDELBROT
Your translation has the information I was hoping for! I can cure them!

Mandelbrot swipes out.

CONTROL
Would you like me to sing you a song, Celsus?

WATSON
Oh bugger off.

INT. MANDELBROT'S QUARTERS -- DAY

[[PLOT POINT: The Captain must decide if she will remove the Karamean DNA and become fully human]]

Mandelbrot is talking to the Captain, whose moods are wildly varying.

MANDELBROT
It's safe and effective! I've already treated Wilco. She's fully recovered, and off to see her father.

DRAGUER
She was a newbie. A transplant. I've been this way my whole life. This is who I am.

MANDELBROT
You are yourself! Just yourself. For most of your life you had no idea of your genetics. They had no effect until recently! We can silence your karamean genes again. 

DRAGUER
And give up this strength, this power?

MANDELBROT
Reclaim your humanity!

DRAGUER
Who needs it?

MANDELBROT
I do.

DRAGUER
You? You want me to...

MANDELBROT
Become human again. Please?

Draguer looks at her, trying to decide.

> FADE OUT
